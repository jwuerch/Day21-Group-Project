           <!-- <p>NextStep is a project designed for the Epicodus Group Week. It is a job search engine that displays links for different tech job openings based on programming language picked from the user. Its functionality is easy to understand and the user can comfortably find articles, blogs, meet-ups and local companies. The user can create a portfolio with NextStep that companies looking to hire can browse through. The design is completed using CSS and boostrap.</p> -->
          <p>NextStep was founded in January 2016 by 4 students of Epicodus. These students were tired of the typical job search engine, and strived to create a better experience for those on the hunt. Thus, NextStep was born!</p>

          <p>NextStep is a next generation job search engine of the future. It was created with the Epicodus graduate in mind, who is looking to take the "Next Step" <strong>LOL</strong>. Users can select their core coding language, and NextStep will display a number of resources pertaining to said language. Resources include but are not limited to job openings, job fairs, meetups, language tutorials, etc.</p>

          <p>But wait! There's more! Users can create a portfolio with NextStep that allows potential employers to browse through. On the flip side, potential employers can also create portfolios as well. NextStep will take it another level, and match users with employers and employers with users.</p>
